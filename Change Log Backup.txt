	[ ] - 
	
** Errors/Issues **
	1) [Resolved] Skill Display does not show root skills levels on page load.
		- Steps to Check
			1) Ran "console.log(this.AM.skillList)" => Returned array of 18 skill objects from list
			2) Ran "console.log(this.AM.skillList.length)" => Returned 0
			3) Clicked on Project tile and updateSkill ran, saw console logs as expected and correct length reported.
		- Resoloution: 
			- Constructors were working at the same time.  Determined issue by adding a console.log to a then statement after the skills import completed
			- Fixed by adding a boolean BehaviorSubject that skill-display.service.ts can listen for before it querys the list

		b) [Resolved 6/27/2017 - 13:00] Worked towards resolving the issue by adding a try/catch block around 
			- Block allowed for the following to show up in the console: 
			
			0) skillList Query: 													skill-display.service.ts:45    
				Skill Name: Theater 												skill-display.service.ts:55 
			Catch: TypeError: Cannot read property 'toString' of undefined			skill-container.component.ts:30
			
			-  Wrote skillList to console and found that the root skills (i.e. Theater had a domain of "undefined"):
			
				0: 
					Skill domain: undefined
					experienceYear: Thu Feb 01 2007 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)
					level: "Intermediate"
					name: "Theater"
			- This caused an error when the program attempted to grab the domain of the Skills and run: undefined.toString()
	
	2) Skill Display does not show root skills levels on page load.
		- Steps to Check
			1) Ran "console.log(this.AM.skillList)" => Returned array of 18 skill objects from list
			2) Ran "console.log(this.AM.skillList.length)" => Returned 0
			3) Clicked on Project tile and updateSkill ran, saw console logs as expected and correct length reported.
